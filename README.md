## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My Name is Andy and I am a junior full stack developer at the start of my journey! So far, I have made projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, SQL and Python!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a group project to make a site for developer profiles, where you can upload your ressumes and project READMES and cuistomise the layout.   
- ðŸŒ± My learning journey: I have justn finished a 16 week Fullstack bootcamp with [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). I have continued my journey with a server of my alumni to tackle commonly used frontend/backendframeworks (React, Vue.js Django) and keep engaged and progress the skills I have already copvered in the bootcamp.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with growing my development skills. If anyone has any feedback or advice please reach out to me on my email 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Anything! No really I am always looking to grow my understanding and contacts. 
  - If you want to discuss any of my projects.
  - A collaboration or work oppurtunity. 
  - Or even the things I like to do (Cycling reading) or what games/TV/Movies/Books im enjoying at the moment.
