## Hi there 👋
My Name is Andy and I am a junior full stack developer at the start of my journey! So far, I have made projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, SQL and Python!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a group project to make a site for developer profiles, where you can upload your ressumes and project READMES and cuistomise the layout.   

- 🌱 My learning journey: I have just finished a 16 week Fullstack bootcamp with [<img width="16" height="16" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97217ae9-4d20-4140-bd45-dbeb06a9e1e6" />
Code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). I have continued my journey with a number of my alumni to  work on projects focusing on tackling commonly used frontend/backend frameworks (React, Vue.js Django) and keep engaged and progress the skills I have already covered in the bootcamp.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with growing my development skills. If anyone has any feedback or advice please reach out to me on my email 

- 💬 Ask me about Anything! No really I am always looking to grow my understanding and contacts. 
  - If you want to discuss any of my projects.
  - A collaboration or work oppurtunity. 
  - Or even the things I like to do (Cycling, reading) or what games/TV/Movies/Books im enjoying at the moment.

I made a mock SaaS project where users can create KPIs and log their contributions to them. You can view the KPI contributions in a chart of your choice for easy readability. KPIS can be set to teams or individual progress to make sure the people who need to see them can!
