I made a mock SaaS project where users can create KPIs and log their contributions to them. You can view the KPI contributions in a chart of your choice for easy readability. KPIS can be set to teams or individual progress to make sure the people who need to see them can!

My Mind is a project on a subject I care about a lot, mental health. It is a streamlined, one-page website that prioritizes crisis intervention and immediate resource access. The design focuses on simplicity, speed, and accessibility to ensure people in mental health crises can quickly find the help they need.
